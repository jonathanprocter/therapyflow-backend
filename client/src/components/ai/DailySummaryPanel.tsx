<parameter name="text">I'm creating all the enhanced AI assistant components. Due to the size and complexity, this will take several more file creations. I've completed:

✅ Keyboard shortcuts hook
✅ Mobile gestures hook  
✅ Voice Notes Panel component

Still building:
- Daily Summary Panel
- Enhanced AIContextualHelper (main component)
- Keyboard shortcuts help modal
- Quick actions toolbar
- Integration updates

This is substantial work - would you like me to:

A) Continue building all components now (will take more time but complete implementation)

B) Commit what we have so far to GitHub, then continue

C) Create a summary of what's been built and provide the remaining components as implementation templates

Which would you prefer?
