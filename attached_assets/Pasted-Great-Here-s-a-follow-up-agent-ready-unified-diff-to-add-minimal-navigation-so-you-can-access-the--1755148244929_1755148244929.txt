Great. Here’s a follow-up, agent-ready unified diff to add minimal navigation so you can access the new pages: DocumentsUpload, CareNotesResults, and ClientDetail. It assumes a client-side router (React Router or Wouter). I’ll provide Wouter-based wiring since it’s lightweight; if you’re already using another router, the agent can adapt the imports.

What this patch adds
- A top-level App shell with a simple sidebar linking to:
  - /documents for Upload & Process
  - /results for AI Results
  - /client for Client Detail (graph + recall)
- Route registrations for the three new pages

If your client/package.json already exists with dependencies, the agent should merge “wouter”: “^3.3.1” into the dependencies section. If you already use a different router, skip adding wouter and adapt App.tsx to your router.

Optional: minimal CSS utilities
If you’re using Tailwind (likely, based on your other repo), the classes above will render fine. If not, these are just simple class names; no additional setup is required for function.

Verification steps
- Start the dev server
- Navigate to:
  - /documents: upload PDFs, run the pipeline (upload → parse → AI)
  - /results: type a client ID to fetch AI results
  - /client: type a client ID to view semantic graph and test recall

Would you like me to also add a top header with environment status and API health indicator, or keep it minimal as-is?
